# Testnet fixtures — Phase 1 ground-truth evidence

This directory records the **real, on-chain** testnet proof for Phase 1 of
`stellar-agent-guard-contracts`. Every transaction below was actually submitted
to Stellar testnet and verified via Horizon / the RPC at the time of writing.
Nothing here is simulated.

The policies installed:

```
# Scenarios 1–4 (6f17c570…):
per_tx_cap: 1000, window_cap: 150, window_secs: 60,
assets: [token], recipients: [GDUYLF…], dms_grace_secs: 0 (DMS off)

# DMS scenario (1ddad388…): same policy with dms_grace_secs: 60
```

## How scenarios were executed

The `stellar` CLI cannot sign Soroban auth entries whose address is a
**contract** (the guard) — it only signs for the transaction source account and
errors with "Missing signing key for account C…" (known CLI limitation). So
submissions go through the repo's `tools/agent-tx` helper, which does exactly
what Phase 2's SDK must do:

1. Build the `SorobanAuthorizationEntry` for the **guard** address with the
   agent's registered Ed25519 key (same `HashIdPreimage::SorobanAuthorization`
   payload the host hands to `__check_auth`).
2. Simulate the call — the enforced simulation runs the **real** `__check_auth`
   against live testnet state, so policy blocks surface pre-broadcast.
3. On approval, submit and report the on-chain result.

Each invocation uses a fresh tx sequence as the auth nonce (the SAC's replay
protection records every consumed nonce on-chain; the guard's own `__check_auth`
ignores nonces, per SPEC §6).

## The five scenarios — real results

### 1. Allowed transaction — PASSED on-chain

```text
agent-tx transfer --guard CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
    --token CBLQLJAG72M4XQRJMQHSKYIFVHQD7LNTNOQH2GRMCMBWMSLBSLTGTJC7 \
    --to GDUYLFVFLVISVOM5FK5KTBA446VQQ7NBRRFMLNLKLISKL26LJGKUVRRX --amount 50
→ submitted: hash=4c5759298c0364b01d386a5935b964532b04978ea595d96d904d9011f58d64b8 status=PENDING
→ RESULT: ALLOWED tx=4c5759298c0364b01d386a5935b964532b04978ea595d96d904d9011f58d64b8
```

Horizon: `successful: true`, ledger 4566285, created 08:10:12Z. The guard's
`event_auth_checked, allowed` event was emitted by the guard contract during the
enforced preflight (topic symbols `auth_checked` / `allowed`), and the SAC
`transfer` event fired on-chain. Funds moved from the guard account to the
allowed recipient.

> Note: a debug-era transfer of the same shape landed earlier as
> `6f5dd410d62e8d83b4d70330d3541ac40678f05b545a4584cbf8e4dce6d07d9b` (ledger
> 4565852) while bring-up of the submission tool was still in progress; the
> five canonical scenarios above and below are the ones recorded here.

### 2. Per-tx cap violation — BLOCKED (pre-broadcast)

```text
agent-tx transfer … --to GDUYLF… --amount 1100 --expect-blocked   # 1100 > per_tx_cap 1000
→ BLOCKED (pre-broadcast, enforced simulation)
```

Guard diagnostic event (from the enforced simulation, real `__check_auth`):

```
[Contract Event] topics: [event_auth_checked, blocked, per_tx_cap_exceeded]
```

No transaction was broadcast — the violation was caught by `__check_auth`
before the SAC call could be authorized. Verified against live testnet state.

### 3. Rolling-window cap violation — BLOCKED (pre-broadcast)

Sequence: after scenario 1 spent 50 in the window, a second transfer of 110
(50 + 110 = 160 > window_cap 150) within the 60s window:

```text
agent-tx transfer … --to GDUYLF… --amount 110 --expect-blocked   # window 50+110=160 > 150
→ BLOCKED (pre-broadcast, enforced simulation)
```

Guard diagnostic event:

```
[Contract Event] topics: [event_auth_checked, blocked, window_cap_exceeded]
```

This is a **genuinely rolling** 60-second window (SPENT entries carry
`spent_ts`; expired entries are pruned at evaluation time — see
`src/window.rs`), not a fixed-bucket reset.

### 4. Allowlist violation — BLOCKED (pre-broadcast)

```text
agent-tx transfer … --to GDMVA2IQH63BYCFZMOVDYCUDGJZYSUCDGCVFDPU5BLTHFUEZ6BF5EPP7 \
    --amount 10 --expect-blocked
→ BLOCKED (pre-broadcast, enforced simulation)
```

Guard diagnostic event:

```
[Contract Event] topics: [event_auth_checked, blocked, recipient_not_allowed]
```

The recipient is not in the policy's `recipients` allowlist; the transfer never
reached the token contract.

### 5. Dead-man switch — trigger FROZEN, then reversal UNFROZEN

Policy with `dms_grace_secs: 60` was installed (tx `1ddad388…`), which starts
the DMS clock (`LastHeartbeat = now` at install, per SPEC §5). After the 60s
grace lapsed with no heartbeat:

```text
agent-tx transfer … --amount 10 --expect-blocked   # 65s after policy install, no heartbeat
→ BLOCKED (pre-broadcast, enforced simulation)
```

Guard diagnostic event:

```
[Contract Event] topics: [event_auth_checked, blocked, heartbeat_expired]
```

Reversal via admin `unfreeze()` (the SPEC §5 reversal path — silence cannot
self-revive; heartbeats are also blocked once expired, so only the admin
attestation restores the account):

```text
stellar contract invoke --id CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
    --network testnet --source guard_admin --send=yes -- unfreeze
→ ✅ Transaction submitted successfully!  tx=dd327d32b18bfc6cebdf6c956503fe5318e28f8a8bc86a88cb7ee42c5d46b5e5
→ Event: EventUnfrozen (event_unfrozen), by: "GD5S5O2MZ6FSMFH6QILG37KSQNRVR3RPSWBTTV4JOUJ7J6TWLLL5LAVS"
```

Immediately after, the agent's transfer works again:

```text
agent-tx transfer … --amount 10
→ submitted: hash=b39457afa59f20d6ac90cd137e917c7efd51e27af4913c6c6308a6e5d0eff512 status=PENDING
→ RESULT: ALLOWED tx=b39457afa59f20d6ac90cd137e917c7efd51e27af4913c6c6308a6e5d0eff512
```

## How to re-run

1. `cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none` (contract) and
   `cd tools/agent-tx && cargo build --release` (submission helper).
2. Fund fresh accounts via Friendbot, deploy the guard + token, mint, and
   `initialize` (see setup txs above).
3. Install the scenario policies (JSON in `--config`), then run the
   `agent-tx` invocations above. Use `--expect-blocked` for scenarios 2–5.

The five blocked/emitted events above are the contract's own
`event_auth_checked` topics — grep the enforced-simulation output for
`blocked, <reason>` to confirm each.
